Welcome to the GitHub page for my Master Thesis project! In this project, I am building a Data-Driven Agent-Based model (using Python and Netlogo) to simulate the behavior of citizens in the city of The Hague, The Netherlands. The key focus of the project is to observe the decision-making process of migrants who enter the city as new citizens and the resulting changes to the city with regards to their decision on where to live.
